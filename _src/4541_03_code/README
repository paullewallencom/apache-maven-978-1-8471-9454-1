This chapter's sample code contains two source trees:

* start

This is the Centrepoint application built up to the section "Fleshing
out the example application". It can be used as a basis for the rest of
the exercises in the chapter.

* final

This is the Centrepoint application as it should be at the end of the
chapter. This can be used as a basis for the examples in chapter 4.
Likewise, the code from chapter 4 can be used as a basis for the
examples in chapter 5, and so on.


Each subdirectory contains their own README with instructions on
how to build the application.
